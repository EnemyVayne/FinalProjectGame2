# FinalProjectGame2
Directions for playing the game:
W = move up
A = move left
S = move down
D = move right
B = go back home(NPC will spawn)
Space(on title screen) = swaps screens to home

To attack enemies(red squares) you must move into them to deal damage, and you can heal by moving away, unless they die, which means you must move into the next scene to heal up, or you can push B to heal to full and then go out exploring again. 
To interact with the NPC, you must move into them to open the shop, which you can buy weapons or boots, weapons allow you to deal more damage, while boots allow you to move faster. 

Checkpoint 1: Created the window, the backgrounds, the player and movement, set up boundries(but cant walk through them or you will get stuck), created a titlescreen, and added keyboard inputs.

Checkpoint 2: Created enemies which can move, added boundaries for the enemies and player, added collsion between objects, music, coins, and hp bars for enemy and player.

Final Checkpoint: We bugfixed the movement when swapping scenes, bugfixed correctly destroying enemies boundries, created an npc, created a shop pane to shop for items, added functionality for items to augment abilities within game, bugfixed coins not updating, randomized the enemy spawn and healthbar, added boundaries for the npc.
